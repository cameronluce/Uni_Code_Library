    "PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that allows you to write your own neural networks and optimize them efficiently. However, PyTorch is not the only framework of its kind. Alternatives to PyTorch include [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#quickstart-colab-in-the-cloud) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). We choose to teach PyTorch at the University of Amsterdam because it is well established, has a huge developer community (originally developed by Facebook), is very flexible and especially used in research. Many current papers publish their code in PyTorch, and thus it is good to be familiar with PyTorch as well.\n",
    "Meanwhile, TensorFlow (developed by Google) is usually known for being a production-grade deep learning library. Still, if you know one machine learning framework in depth, it is very easy to learn another one because many of them use the same concepts and ideas. For instance, TensorFlow's version 2 was heavily inspired by the most popular features of PyTorch, making the frameworks even more similar.\n",

You should therefore see the output `Using torch 2.4.1`, eventually with some extension for the CUDA version on Colab. In case you use the `dl2024` environment, you should see `Using torch 2.4.1`. In general, it is recommended to keep the PyTorch version updated to the newest one. If you see a lower version number than 2.3, make sure you have installed the correct environment, or ask one of your TAs. In case PyTorch 2.5 or newer will be published during the time of the course, don't worry. The interface between PyTorch versions doesn't change too much, and hence all code should also be runnable with newer versions.\n",

    "* `torch.matmul`: Performs the matrix product over two tensors, where the specific behavior depends on the dimensions. If both inputs are matrices (2-dimensional tensors), it performs the standard matrix product. For higher dimensional inputs, the function supports broadcasting (for details see the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.matmul.html?highlight=matmul#torch.matmul)). Can also be written as `a @ b`, similar to numpy.\n",

    "* `torch.bmm`: Performs the matrix product with a support batch dimension. If the first tensor $T$ is of shape ($b\\times n\\times m$), and the second tensor $R$ ($b\\times m\\times p$), the output $O$ is of shape ($b\\times n\\times p$), and has been calculated by performing $b$ matrix multiplications of the submatrices of $T$ and $R$: $O_i = T_i @ R_i$\n",
    "* `torch.einsum`: Performs matrix multiplications and more (i.e. sums of products) using the Einstein summation convention. Explanation of the Einstein sum can be found in assignment 1.\n",

    "### Dynamic Computation Graph and Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for using PyTorch in Deep Learning projects is that we can automatically get **gradients/derivatives** of functions that we define. We will mainly use PyTorch for implementing neural networks, and they are just fancy functions. If we use weight matrices in our function that we want to learn, then those are called the **parameters** or simply the **weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our neural network would output a single scalar value, we would talk about taking the **derivative**, but you will see that quite often we will have **multiple** output variables (\"values\"); in that case we talk about **gradients**. It's a more general term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input $\\mathbf{x}$, we define our function by **manipulating** that input, usually by matrix-multiplications with weight matrices and additions with so-called bias vectors. As we manipulate our input, we are automatically creating a **computational graph**. This graph shows how to arrive at our output from our input.\n",
    "PyTorch is a **define-by-run** framework; this means that we can just do our manipulations, and PyTorch will keep track of that graph for us. Thus, we create a dynamic computation graph along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to recap: the only thing we have to do is to compute the **output**, and then we can ask PyTorch to automatically get the **gradients**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:  Why do we want gradients?** Consider that we have defined a function, a neural net, that is supposed to compute a certain output $y$ for an input vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We then define an **error measure** that tells us how wrong our network is; how bad it is in predicting output $y$ from input $\\mathbf{x}$. Based on this error measure, we can use the gradients to **update** the weights $\\mathbf{W}$ that were responsible for the output, so that the next time we present input $\\mathbf{x}$ to our network, the output will be closer to what we want.\n",

The zero next to cuda indicates that this is the zero-th GPU device on your computer. PyTorch also supports multi-GPU systems, but this you will only need once you have very big networks to train (if interested, see the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#distributed-basics)). We can also compare the runtime of a large matrix multiplication on the CPU with a operation on the GPU:"
